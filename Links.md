### The releases page of jc where you can get binaries for your system

[JC Releases](https://github.com/kellyjonbrazil/jc/releases)


I found that on Debian Bullseye (v11) it was better
to get the tarball for x64 Linux and extract then mv the 'jc' file into your $PATH

On MacOS:

```bash
brew install jc
```
