# Nushell: An Introduction

## What

Nushell is a modern re-interpretation of what a system shell should be.
Nushell combines features and practices from current software engineering
and traditional Unix-like OS shells. Nushell borrows concepts from Bash,
Zsh and PowerShell. It also borrows programming language constructs from
scripting languages like Python, Ruby and functional programming languages.


## Platforms

Nushell is designed to be cross-platform. It runs on:

- Windows
- MacOS
- Linux*

## Implemented in Rust a safe compiled systems programming language

* Because it is written in Rust, it should compile on all platforms that Rust
targets. Although not mentioned, other Unix-like systems such as the *BSDs should
should be made able to work.

## Who is it for?

Nushell, although a very young shell, nevertheless can be used by anyone who
wants to interact with the command line or terminal of their system to perform
tasks that would be tricky to write in other shells.


### Potential users

- Data Scientists
- System admins who needto pull and transform lots of data
- Programmers who need to automate tasks, beef up their FP creds, .etc
- New users to the Terminal environment
- The Shell-curiou

s
Nushell can be used as either in interactive mode as a REPL or as a script
interpreter. IOW, you can use Nushell wherever you use any other shell or
scripting language or alongside them.

## Is it production ready?

At this time, I would not use Nushell to control your critical infrastructure.

## Installation

- homebrew: 'brew install nushell'
- winget: 'winget install nushell'

Available in some Linux package  distros' app repositories
