# File formats and databases

## Abstract 

## Nushell works with many file formats and databases

If you know any Rust, you are probably aware of the crate: SerDe, a Swiss Army
knife of many file format serializers and deserializers. Nushell essentially
exposes the SerDe crate to shell users.

## Some file formats
- Excel
- XML
- JSON
- YAML
- CSV

## Databases

Support for SQLite db

```sh
open customers.db
```

## FIXME - Should there be output?
