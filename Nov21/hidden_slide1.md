## History of the shell

0. Punch card/paper tape batch data processing
1. Simple system consoles
  * IPL
  * Diagnostics and monitoring
2. Multi-processing and simultaneous jobs
  * Divide and conquer because I/O is slower than CPU  so work inside the blocked wait cycles
3. JCL
  * Later versions have features similar to shells developed in the 70s and 80s.
4. Simple shells like Thompson shell and PWB
5. Arrival of Steve Bourne
  * and the rest is history

Then a long progression of incremental improvements
Like Korn shell, C shell and then Bash
Which is not going anywhere soon.

The next leap? forward might be Powershell with its addition of object pipelines
alongside of simple  text only streams

Nushell begs, borrows and steals from all that has gone before.
Focusing on running structured data through data pipelines.
It also borrows ideas from SQL and relational  database techniques.
