# Stan, Read this first: Do not include in slide deck!

First off: Thank you very much for doing this. If you have any questions re: this material, feel free to call or email me at any time.  We can also get on Mumble if that is easier.


This content can also be found @ the link to the GitHub repo in the last link in slide4.md
in the './Nov21/' folder
If I add/clarify any changes I will push them there first.

There  are 4 slides:

slide1.md, slide2.md, slide3.md and slide4.md

There is a break between slide3.md and slide4.md for a live demo.

The last slide: slide4.md is just the conclusion and links for the final wrapup.

There might be Q & A after or during the live demo.

Note: slide1.md:

Please find the Ed Howland BIO you used for the previous Nushll demo at St. Louis Linux User's Group earlier this year.


## Overall notes

A rough draft. Probably many spelling mistakes

Not sure how the format to an actual Impress (LibreOffice)  will be layed out.

If you need more slides to fit, then feel free.

Regards, Ed
